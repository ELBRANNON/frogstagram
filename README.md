### **What is frogstagram?**

Frogstagram is a photo sharing app that allows users to upload photos of frogs and view photos of frogs uploaded by other users. Users can also comment on photos and like photos.

Only users who are logged in can upload photos and comment on photos. Users can also delete their own photos and comments.

The catch with frogstagram is that it only allows photos of frogs to be uploaded. If a user tries to upload a photo that is not of a frog, they will be notified that their photo is not a frog and will not be able to upload it. Determining whether a photo is a frog or not a frog is done by a machine learning algorithm that is trained on a dataset of photos.
